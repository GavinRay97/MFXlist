# MFXlist
This is a script for the Reaper DAW (digital audio workstation), that adds an FX strip to the left of the TCP for quick and easy access. The original idea comes from Doppelganger's fxlist, but this is a native ReaScript re-implmentation of the FX strip part of fxlist. MFXlist packages existing functionality in a better (to my opinion) package than the native implementation.
